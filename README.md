# Awesome Quiz Frontend

## Dev Dependencies

**_Note:_** _These are only required for testing_

- NodeJS
- npm
- Jasmine

## Testing

Testing is a simple call with npm:

```sh
$ npm test
```

## Running

Running is also quite simple, using the python http server then open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

```sh
$ python -m http.server
```

## Outstanding Issues

- No retry button when completing the quiz, and an error occurs
- No loader graphics, just text
- Better optimized background image, too large
